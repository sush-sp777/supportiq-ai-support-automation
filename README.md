# 🚀 SupportIQ – AI-Powered Customer Support Automation Platform

- SupportIQ is an AI-powered customer support automation system that intelligently triages support tickets, decides whether they can be safely auto-resolved, and assists human agents when needed.
- The system combines structured LLM classification, risk-based decision logic, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to create a safe and practical AI support workflow.
---

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer support teams spend significant time:

- Manually categorizing tickets
- Prioritizing requests
- Answering repetitive questions
- Escalating sensitive issues

SupportIQ automates this process using AI — but with guardrails.

Instead of blindly auto-replying, the system:

- Classifies the ticket using an LLM
- Evaluates risk and confidence
- Decides whether to auto-resolve or escalate
- Assists agents with AI-generated drafts when needed

This ensures automation without losing human control.

## 🎯 Key Features
### ✅ AI Ticket Triage (Structured Output)

- Classifies tickets into categories
- Assigns priority level
- Detects sentiment
- Evaluates risk (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
- Calculates confidence score
- Generates a short AI summary

The LLM returns structured JSON, making the system reliable and predictable.

### ✅ Risk-Based Decision Engine

After AI classification, a rule-based decision engine determines:
- Low risk + high confidence → Auto resolve
- Otherwise → Route to human agent

This prevents unsafe automation.

### ✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

For auto-resolved tickets:

- Retrieves relevant information from internal knowledge base
- Uses embeddings + vector search (FAISS)
- Generates grounded responses
- Reduces hallucination risk

### ✅ Human-in-the-Loop Agent Assistance

For escalated tickets:

- Agents can generate AI reply drafts
- AI uses:
  - Ticket context
  - Conversation history
  - Sentiment
  - Risk level
- Agent reviews and sends final response

AI assists — humans stay in control.

### ✅ Role-Based Authentication

- JWT-based authentication
- USER and AGENT roles
- Secure password hashing
- Protected endpoints

## 🔄 Ticket Workflow

### 1️⃣ User Creates Ticket

- Ticket stored in PostgreSQL
- AI triage automatically runs

### 2️⃣ AI Classification

The system extracts:
- Category
- Priority
- Sentiment
- Risk
- Confidence
- Summary

### 3️⃣ Decision Engine

If:
- Confidence ≥ 0.70
- Risk = LOW
→ Ticket is auto-resolved

Else:

→ Ticket is assigned to agent queue

### 4️⃣ Agent Handling (If Escalated)

- Agent reviews ticket
- Option to generate AI draft
- Agent edits and sends final response
