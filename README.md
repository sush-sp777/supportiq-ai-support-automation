# 🚀 SupportIQ – AI-Powered Customer Support Automation Platform

- SupportIQ is an AI-powered customer support automation system that intelligently triages support tickets, decides whether they can be safely auto-resolved, and assists human agents when needed.
- The system combines structured LLM classification, risk-based decision logic, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to create a safe and practical AI support workflow.

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer support teams spend significant time:

- Manually categorizing tickets
- Prioritizing requests
- Answering repetitive questions
- Escalating sensitive issues

SupportIQ automates this process using AI — but with guardrails.

Instead of blindly auto-replying, the system:

- Classifies the ticket using an LLM
- Evaluates risk and confidence
- Decides whether to auto-resolve or escalate
- Assists agents with AI-generated drafts when needed

This ensures automation without losing human control.
